# 🌚 Just a little corner of the internet, Hi! 👋

![Coding at 3am](./assets/lapar.gif)

I'm just a regular dev, writing code at ungodly hours while chewing satay and reading bug reports like bedtime stories.

Sometimes it compiles. Sometimes I cry 😭

## 🧠 Skills I pretend to have

- 🧱 Stack: Rust, Rust, more Rust, emotional instability, and a tiny bit of Bash.
- 🧯 Firefighting production bugs I introduced
- 🧃 Consuming caffeine at suspiciously unhealthy levels

## 🚧 Currently building

- A feature nobody asked for, but Product said it's “critical”
- A healthy sleep schedule (spoiler: it’s failing CI)
- Fixing bugs I created at 2AM last week
- Pretending to understand Kubernetes
